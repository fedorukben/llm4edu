                    With the widespread public adoption of large language models, the number of available models has ballooned. Thus, it becomes increasingly difficult to select an ideal model, often leading to decisional procrastination. That said, the selection of LLM is crucial. Different LLMs are better suited for different tasks.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Large language models (LLMs) are artificial intelligence (AI) systems trained on textual data that can generate human-like text. LLMs can support educational tasks by aiding in content creation, personalization, feedback, and administrative support.

                            A high school teacher wants to create differentiated learning materials for a unit on climate change that includes visual components. They need the most current information available and want to integrate the materials with existing Google Classroom resources. Which LLM would you recommend they use? Justify your recommendation based on specific features mentioned in the module. What limitations might they encounter with your recommended LLM?

                            You are a professor at a rural college with unreliable internet access. You need to develop a comprehensive literature review for a research paper on quantum physics, using a large corpus of academic papers you have stored locally. The review must incorporate complex mathematical thinking and maintain high factual accuracy. Which LLM would be most appropriate for this task? Explain your choice. What workarounds might you need to implement to address any limitations of your chosen model?

                            A middle school English teacher is developing an engaging creative writing unit. They want students to interact with an AI that can make traditionally dry grammar and storytelling concepts more appealing through humor and personality. The teacher also wants to use this interaction to teach students about evaluating sources critically. Recommend an LLM combination that would serve these dual purposes. Justify why you would combine these specific LLMs based on their strengths. How would this combination address the dimensions of "Audience" and "Purpose" mentioned in this module?
